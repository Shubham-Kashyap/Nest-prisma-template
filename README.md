> This project is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, with Prisma as the ORM. It leverages the power of SWC for faster compilation, and includes a global interceptor for standardized response handling, an incoming request logger, and constants for custom messages and Swagger API documentation.

## Features

### SWC in Nest
- Faster build times and quicker recompilation.
- Optimized for both development and production environments.

### Global Response Interceptor
- Standardizes API responses for consistency.
- Handles success and error responses uniformly.

### Incoming Request Logger
- Logs details of all incoming requests for better monitoring and debugging.
- Integrates seamlessly with NestJS's logging mechanism.

### Constants for Custom Messages and Swagger API
- Centralized custom messages for application-wide use.
- Enhanced Swagger API documentation with clear, consistent descriptions.

### Custom param decorators
- Enhanced custom decorators that provides the ability to define query params for Swagger directly from the decorators, eliminating the need to define each query param separately in controller functions.
