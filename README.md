> This project is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, with Prisma as the ORM. It leverages the power of
> SWC for faster compilation, and includes a global interceptor for standardized response handling, an incoming request
> logger, and constants for custom messages and a separate Swagger documentation for admin and web users. This ensures
> that each user type only accesses the relevant APIs and documentation, enhancing security and user experience.

## Features

### SWC in Nest

-   Faster build times and quicker recompilation.
-   Optimized for both development and production environments.

### Global Response Interceptor

-   Standardizes API responses for consistency.
-   Handles success and error responses uniformly.

### Incoming Request Logger

-   Logs details of all incoming requests for better monitoring and debugging.
-   Integrates seamlessly with NestJS's logging mechanism.

### Constants for Custom Messages and Swagger API

-   Centralized custom messages for application-wide use.
-   Enhanced Swagger API documentation with clear, consistent descriptions.

### Custom Param Decorators

-   Enhanced custom decorators that provides the ability to define query params for Swagger directly from the
    decorators, eliminating the need to define each query param separately in controller functions.

### Dual Swagger Interfaces

-   Two distinct Swagger UI interfaces are provided - one for admin users and another for web users. Each interface only
    displays the APIs relevant to that user type.

### Role-Based Access Control

-   The documentation access is controlled based on user roles. Admin users have access to a comprehensive set of APIs,
    while web users have limited access tailored to their needs.

### Customizable Documentation

-   Both Swagger interfaces are fully customizable. You can easily modify the API descriptions and parameters to suit
    the needs of each user type.
